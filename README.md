# TypeScript Redux

This guide goes through setting up, running and exploring the ultimate JavaScript Stack du jour:

  - [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Superset of JavaScript with optional typing, advanced language features and down-level ES5 support
  - [JSPM](http://jspm.io/) - JavaScript Package Manager supporting SystemJS modules and multiple npm and GitHub repositories 
  - [typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) - Package manager to search and install TypeScript definition files
  - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Simple, high-performance JavaScript UI Framework utilizing a Virtual DOM and Reactive Data flows
  - [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) - Predictable state manager for JavaScript Apps
  
Providing a great base for the development of large-scale, JavaScript Apps that's further enhanced by a great 
development experience within Visual Studio.

## Install TypeScript

If you haven't already download and install the latest version from 
[typescriptlang.org](http://www.typescriptlang.org). Visual Studio users can use these direct links:

 - [VS.NET 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48593)
 - [VS.NET 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48739)

> This guide assumes you've installed TypeScript v1.8 or higher

### [VS.NET 2015 Install Package](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/753b9720-1638-4f9a-ad8d-2c45a410fd74)

Visual Studio 2015 also has a 
[Package Installer](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/753b9720-1638-4f9a-ad8d-2c45a410fd74) 
add-on providing an Integrated UI for installing npm and JSPM packages as well as typings Type Definitions:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/vs-install-jspm-package.png)](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/753b9720-1638-4f9a-ad8d-2c45a410fd74) 

It's autocomplete feature is particularly useful for quickly finding packages you don't know the exact name of:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/vs-jspm-autocomplete.png)](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/753b9720-1638-4f9a-ad8d-2c45a410fd74) 

Although for this guide we'll install JavaScript packages using the command-line which offers better visibility 
of how external packages integrates with your project and all fits together.

## Create an Empty ASP.NET Web Project

Whilst installing the TypeScript VS.NET Extension provides a new **HTML Application with TypeScript** project
template, you're better off starting from an **Empty ASP.NET Web Application** project then configuring 
it with TypeScript - saving the time to convert it into an ASP.NET Web Application later.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/01-empty-web-project.png)

Choose the **Empty** template for a clean Web Application free of unnecessary bloat:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/02-empty-web-template.png)

### Enable TypeScript

Adding a **TypeScript File** from the `Add > TypeScript File` context menu will automatically configure your
Web Application Project `.csproj` with the necessary imports to enable TypeScript support:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/03-add-typescript-file.png)

As confirmed by the subsequent prompt:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/04-typescript-confirmation-dialog.png)

Click **No** to skip opening a NuGet dialog as you'll instead be sourcing your TypeScript definitions from the 
[typings Package Manager](https://github.com/typings/typings) we'll install later.

### Configure TypeScript

Once TypeScript is enabled you want to configure it within your project. Prior to TypeScript 1.8 on VS.NET 2015
the configuration properties for the TypeScript Compiler was embedded in the VS **.csproj** file which you 
could manage from the [TypeScript Properties Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/05-configure-typescript-vs.png)
in **Project Properties**.

However our preference is to instead manage the TypeScript options in a plain-text `tsconfig.json` file 
which offers more flexibility and matches how every other IDE/text-editor maintains TypeScript configuration
leading to greater knowledge sharing and less issues. 

To add `tsconfig.json` to your project go to `Add > New Item` and search for **typescript** in the search 
dialog, then select **TypeScript JSON Configuration File** item template: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/05-add-tsconfig.png)

This will add a basic `tsconfig.json` configuration file to your project which VS.NET will use instead of
.csproj Project variables. 

### tsconfig for JSPM, React and JSX

To get started quickly copy + replace the contents of `tsconfig.json` with the configuration below:
 
```json
{
  "compileOnSave":  true,
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "noEmitOnError": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "system",
    "jsx": "react",
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  },
  "exclude": [
    "typings",
    "node_modules",
    "jspm_packages",
    "wwwroot"
  ]
}
```

Changes from the default basic `tsconfig.json` template include:

 - `compileOnSave:true` - to generate TypeScript files on save
 - `target:es5` - to target ES5 JavaScript
 - `module:system` - so TypeScript modules are converted into [SystemJS Modules](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)
 - `jsx:react` - so JSX in `.tsx` files are transpiled into React's JavaScript syntax
 - `experimentalDecorators:true` - to enable proposed ES7 decorators support (used later)
 - `exclude:jspm_packages` - to ignore any TypeScript source files in JSPM packages folder

> [VS 2013 doesn't support tsconfig.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/6782#issuecomment-187820198)
so you'll need to use .csproj configuration managed from TypeScript Project properties page

## Install JSPM

To take full advantage of the modularity functionality available in ES6 and TypeScript we'll also want to use
a client JavaScript package manager which is able to integrate with TypeScript's module support. Currently the 
[preferred option for this is JSPM](http://www.symbiotics.co.za/blog/knowledge-share-2/post/is-bower-dead-what-is-jspm-npm-for-client-side-92)
whose SystemJS module format is natively supported by TypeScript.

To install JSPM we need to head over to the command line, the easiest way is to hold down `Shift` whilst 
right-clicking on your project folder and clicking **Open command window here**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/06-open-command-prompt.png)

With the raw power of the command-line at our finger tips, use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install JSPM:
 
    C:\proj> npm install jspm -g

Once installed you'll want to initialize JSPM and create a config file by running:
 
    C:\proj> jspm init

and run through a few questions that will be used to create JSPM `config.js` file with:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/07-jspm-init.png)

The only question you **won't** want to go with the defaults on and enter **no** for is:

> Do you wish to use a transpiler? [yes]:**no**

As we'll instead be using the TypeScript support in Visual Studio to do our transpiling for us.
    
### Install React

With JSPM all setup we can go shopping for JS packages - the first one we'll need is React:

    C:\proj> jspm install react

Since v0.14 the React support for the DOM is split into a separate package which we'll need as well:

    C:\proj> jspm install react-dom

### Install typings - Manager for TypeScript definitions

To enable auto-completion and type-checking support in TypeScript we'll also want to pull down the 
Type Definitions for our 3rd Party JavaScript libraries. The best way to do this is to install 
[typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) 
which we also install from npm:

    C:\proj> npm install typings -g

We can now use `typings` to fetch the TypeScript Type Definitions we need.

#### Install React Type Definitions

    C:\proj> typings install react --ambient --save

#### Install React DOM Type Definitions

    C:\proj> typings install react-dom --ambient --save

The `--ambient` flag instructs **typings** to look in ambient `.d.ts` TypeScript definitions in 
[DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) repository whilst the 
`--save` flag adds a reference to the common `typings/browser.d.ts` file:

```typescript
/// <reference path="main\ambient\react-dom\react-dom.d.ts" />
/// <reference path="main\ambient\react\react.d.ts" />
```

This is convenient as it means we only need to reference the one file in our source code to import the 
Type Definitions for all our dependencies:

```typescript
/// <reference path='../typings/browser.d.ts'/>
```

## Start TypeScript'ing

Eureka! if you've reached this far we finally have a working development environment and can start putting 
TypeScript and React to work for us. Let's start by creating a `src/` folder where we'll keep all our 
TypeScript source code. We'll start with the simplest of React examples:

## [Example 1 - HelloWorld](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/tree/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example01)

In this first example we're aiming to create the simplest working App. 
Create an `example01/` folder and add our first TypeScript file: 

#### [app.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example01/app.tsx)

```typescript
/// <reference path='../../typings/browser.d.ts'/>

import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class HelloWorld extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld/>, document.getElementById("content"));
```

I'll walk through this as there's a few things going on here, the first line:

```typescript
/// <reference path='../../typings/browser.d.ts'/>
```

Uses a [Reference Tag](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2007/11/06/jscript-intellisense-a-reference-for-the-reference-tag.aspx)
to reference all the [Definitely Typed](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) Type Definitions
installed by **typings**. 

The import statements:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```

Imports the JavaScript modules installed by **jspm**. The `*` wildcard above imports the entire module, 
an alternative syntax is to import only what you need:

```typescript
import { render } from 'react-dom';
```

The exception to this is inside `.tsx` where it requires **React** to be imported with a wildcard import 
otherwise JSX fragments will result in build errors:

    return <div>Hello, World!</div>; //compile error: Cannot find name React

To create a React component we inherit from React's `Component<TProps,TState>` base class:

```typescript
class HelloWorld extends React.Component<any, any> {
```

When Components doesn't have any properties or state they can use `any` to ignore specifying types.

As we've enabled JSX support in our TypeScript configuration we can use JSX inside our **.tsx** files:

```typescript
    render() {
        return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
    }
```

The last line is standard React, instructing it to render an instance of our `HelloWorld` component into the 
`#content` DOM element:

```typescript
ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld/>, document.getElementById("content"));
```

Now all that's left is to build a HTML page to house our newly minted React Component:

#### [index.html](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example01/index.html)


```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>TypeScript + JSPM + React</title>
    <script src="/jspm_packages/system.js"></script>
    <script src="/config.js"></script>
    <script>
        System.import("./app");
    </script>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Example 1</h1>
    <div id="content"></div>

</body>
</html>
```

> **index.html** is a pre-defined default document in ASP.NET which lets us view our app by visiting the 
directory, e.g `/example01/`

Since we're using JSPM we need to import the `system.js` module loader and our JSPM `config.js`:

```html
    <script src="/jspm_packages/system.js"></script>
    <script src="/config.js"></script>
```

But from then on we only need a single import for our **app.tsx**:

```html
    <script>
        System.import("./app");
    </script>
```

Since we didn't configure JSPM to use a transpiler JSPM is only loading our pre-generated `*.js` files which 
thanks to VS.NET's TypeScript integration is generated every time we hit save. This is ideal as it's 
typically generated in-between the time we flip over to the browser to view our App, doesn't require any 
manual post build steps or a separate external process monitoring our source files for changes. 

The nice thing about using a module loader like JSPM is that we no longer need to manage static imports of
3rd party dependencies ourselves since JSPM does all this for us behind the scenes.

The final key element is an empty `<div/>` tag which is where we've instructed React to render our Component:

```html
    <div id="content"></div>
```

And with that we can hit **F5** and head over to  `/example01/` to see the fruits of our labor - 
a working React App!

> Demo: [/typescript-redux/example01/](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example01/)


## Preloading Dependencies

Although the excitement only lasts a short while until you witness a noticeable delay in rendering Hello World? 
Checking the network requests tab shows the root cause: **170 requests** to render the simplest React App!

Since we don't have the luxury of HTTP 2's multiplexed requests in VS.NET's WebDev server, we need to find a
way to get the network requests countdown. The common solution for this is to create an interim bundle with
your 3rd party dependencies which change infrequently. We can do this by creating a simple `.tsx` file
that just references all the 3rd party dependencies you want in the bundle, e.g:

### [deps.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/8fbf5e4d2ed9bddc0ac73a17e3dbb954ffad13b3/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/deps.tsx)

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

class Deps extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        return <div>Hello, World!</div>;  
    }
}

const ignore = () => render(<Deps/>, document.body);
```

We can then use jspm to create a bundle with all the dependencies used into a single .js library, e.g:

    C:\proj> jspm bundle src/deps deps.lib.js

That we then include in our 
[index.html](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example01/index.html)

```html
    <script src="/jspm_packages/system.js"></script>
    <script src="/config.js"></script>
    <script src="/deps.lib.js"></script>
    <script>
        System.import("./app");
    </script>
```

This has the nice effect of preloading all referenced 3rd party modules in a single HTTP Request so by the 
time our App requests use of a 3rd party module, it's already loaded.

### Enable debugging in Browsers

Another nice feature of TypeScript we've yet to explore is its generation of source maps which lets us debug 
our original TypeScript sources directly from within Chrome. However to enable this we need to first register 
our TypeScript file extensions with **Web.config** so they're downloadable. It just so happens that `.ts` is 
already pre-registered with the `video/vnd.dlna.mpeg-tts` mime-type that as a matter of good taste we'd want 
to replace whilst adding a new mimeType mapping for `.tsx` files:

```xml
<system.webServer>
    <staticContent>
        <remove fileExtension=".ts"/>
        <mimeMap fileExtension=".ts" mimeType="application/x-typescript" />
        <mimeMap fileExtension=".tsx" mimeType="application/x-typescript" />
    </staticContent>
</system.webServer>
```

With our website now configured to serve static TypeScript files we can now debug TypeScript directly within Chrome!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/08-debug-tsx.png)

## [Example 2 - Modularizing HelloWorld](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/tree/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example02)

For our 2nd example we'll look at how we can modularize our App by moving the `<HelloWorld />` implementation
into its own file:

### [HelloWorld.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example02/HelloWorld.tsx)

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';

export default class HelloWorld extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
    }
}
```

To make the HelloWorld component available we need to use the `export` keyword. We can also use the `default` 
keyword to define a **default export** which makes it a little nicer to import as consumers can assign it to
their preferred name when importing it.

Then remove the existing HelloWorld implementation from **app.tsx** and import the exported component instead:

### [app.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example02/app.tsx)

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld';

ReactDOM.render(<HelloWorld/>, document.getElementById("content"));
```

If we didn't use a **default export** we'd need to import it with:

```typescript
import { HelloWorld } from './HelloWorld';
```

With this simple change lets check that our App still works:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/preview-02.png)](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example02/)
> Demo: [/typescript-redux/example02/](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example02/)

## [Example 3 - Creating a stateful Component](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/tree/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example03)

Now that we've mastered HelloWorld we'll up our game and create a more advanced component with some state.

About the simplest example we could do for this is a Counter. For this rename `HelloWorld` to `Counter` and 
add the following Component:

#### [Counter.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example03/Counter.tsx)

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';

export default class Counter extends React.Component<any, any> {
    constructor(props, context) {
        super(props, context);
        this.state = { counter: 0 };
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>
                    <label>Counter: </label><b>#{this.state.counter}</b>
                </p>
                <button onClick={e => this.incr(1) }>INCREMENT</button>
                <span style={{ padding: "0 5px" }} />
                <button onClick={e => this.incr(-1) }>DECREMENT</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    incr(by:number) {
        this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + by });
    }
}
```

Nothing surprising here, we're displaying a Counter in a HTML label with buttons to increment / decrement the 
counter using React's built-in `setState()`:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/preview-03.png)](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example03/) 
> Demo: [/typescript-redux/example03/](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example03/)

### Convert Counter to use Redux

Using `setState()` is the old-school way of modifying state in Components, the new hawtness is to use 
[Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux). For this we need to fetch it from JSPM:

    C:\proj> jspm install redux

as well as its Type Definitions:

    C:\proj> typings install redux --ambient --save

## [Example 4 - Change Counter to use Redux](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/tree/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example04)

If you're not familiar with Redux it's a good time to head over to the 
[Redux docs](http://rackt.org/redux/) and read the overview. The 
[30 short videos](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) from Redux creator 
[@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) provides a great way to get up to speed quickly.

Redux is just a small library to manage your App's state which should be maintained in a single Redux store 
that's accessible at anytime with `store.getState()`. The Redux store allows for multiple subscribers to 
subscribe to state changes which must be initiated by dispatching an action. An action being just a plain 
JavaScript object with a `type` string property identifying the action. To change state you implement a 
[reducer](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/basics/Reducers.html) function that takes the **current state** and 
an **action** and whose sole purpose is to return the **next state**. The one caveat is for states to be 
immutable so your reducer will need to return a new object instead of modifying any existing state.

Now we know what Redux is, let's update our Counter to use it:

#### [Counter.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example04/Counter.tsx)

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';

import { createStore } from 'redux';

let store = createStore(
    (state, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'INCR':
                return { counter: state.counter + action.by };
            default:
                return state;
        }
    },
    { counter: 0 });

export default class Counter extends React.Component<any, any> {
    private unsubscribe: Function;
    componentDidMount() {
        this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => this.forceUpdate());
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
        this.unsubscribe();
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>
                    <label>Counter: </label><b>#{store.getState().counter}</b>
                </p>
                <button onClick={e => store.dispatch({ type:'INCR', by: 1 }) }>INCREMENT</button>
                <span style={{ padding: "0 5px" }} />
                <button onClick={e => store.dispatch({ type:'INCR', by: -1 }) }>DECREMENT</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

### Creating a Redux Store

Creating a Redux store is done by calling `createStore` from the **redux** module passing in our Apps reducer 
function and the default state:

```typescript
import { createStore } from 'redux';

let store = createStore(
    (state, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'INCR':
                return { counter: state.counter + action.by };
            default:
                return state;
        }
    },
    { counter: 0 });
```

Since our Counter only has 1 action our reducer implementation becomes trivial - returning a new object with 
an updated Counter.

Another thing to know about Redux is that it's completely independent from React which unlike the built-in 
`setState()` React doesn't know when the state in your Redux store has changed - needed in order to
know when to re-render your Component. For this we need to register a listener so we can force the Component
to re-render itself when the store's state changes:

```typescript
    private unsubscribe: Function;
    
    componentDidMount() {
        this.unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => this.forceUpdate());
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
        this.unsubscribe();
    }
```

We also need to change the component to read its state from `store.getState()` and instead of modifying the
Components internal state with `setState()` we dispatch an action and get our reducer to update the App's state:

```typescript
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>
                    <label>Counter: </label><b>#{store.getState().counter}</b>
                </p>
                <button onClick={e => store.dispatch({ type:'INCR', by: 1 }) }>INCREMENT</button>
                <span style={{ padding: "0 5px" }} />
                <button onClick={e => store.dispatch({ type:'INCR', by: -1 }) }>DECREMENT</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
```

With our Counter now reduxified, running it again retains the same behavior as before:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/preview-04.png)](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example04/)
> Demo: [/typescript-redux/example04/](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example04/)

## Install React Redux

Something that stands out in the previous example is creating the Redux store in the `Counter` module.
Since your App should only have 1 store, this isn't the right place for it. We can remedy this situation 
with a bit of help from Redux's React helper library.

The Redux bindings for React are maintained in a separate `react-redux` package that we can call upon **JSPM** 
to fetch for us:

    C:\proj> jspm install react-redux

Like most popular libraries, there's also a Type Definition for it:

## [Example 5 - Use Provider to inject store in child Context](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/tree/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example05)

For this example, we'll move the Redux store into the top-level **app.tsx** file like so:

#### [app.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example05/app.tsx)

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

import Counter from './Counter';

let store = createStore(
    (state, action) => {
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'INCR':
                return { counter: state.counter + action.by };
            default:
                return state;
        }
    },
    { counter: 0 });

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <Counter />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById("content"));
```

To pass the store down to our components we're going to use 
[React's child context](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html) feature which is nicely packaged 
for us with **react-redux** `<Provider/>` Component.

To let React know we want the store injected into our `Counter` Component we also need to define a static
`contextTypes` property specifying the context it needs:

#### [Counter.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example05/Counter.tsx)

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';

export default class Counter extends React.Component<any, any> {
    context: any;
    static contextTypes = {
        store: React.PropTypes.object
    }
    private unsubscribe: Function;
    componentDidMount() {
        this.unsubscribe = this.context.store.subscribe(() => this.forceUpdate());
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
        this.unsubscribe();
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>
                    <label>Counter: </label><b>#{this.context.store.getState().counter}</b>
                </p>
                <button onClick={e => this.context.store.dispatch({ type:'INCR', by: 1 }) }>INCREMENT</button>
                <span style={{ padding: "0 5px" }} />
                <button onClick={e => this.context.store.dispatch({ type:'INCR', by: -1 }) }>DECREMENT</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

This is another transparent change so our App should continue working:

## [Example 6 - Use connect() to make Components stateless](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/tree/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example06)

We've added a bit of boilerplate to get to where we are but it's now time to pull some of it back. The above 
example shows how we can use the `Provider` Component to pass state down into our child components, 
**react-redux** also has another utility that can abstract the rest away.

Redux's `connect()` function returns a higher-level Component which can make Components stateless, decoupling 
it from the Redux store by mapping its state and callbacks to a Component's properties:

#### [Counter.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example06/Counter.tsx)

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class Counter extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>
                    <label>Counter: </label>
                    <b>#{this.props.counter}</b>
                </p>
                <button onClick={e => this.props.incr() }>INCREMENT</button>
                <span style={{ padding: "0 5px" }} />
                <button onClick={e => this.props.decr() }>DECREMENT</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) => state;

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    incr: () => {
        dispatch({ type: 'INCR', by: 1 });
    },
    decr: () => {
        dispatch({ type: 'INCR', by: -1 });
    }
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

To enable this we pass in a **mapStateToProps** function that returns an object containing all the state our 
component needs. As our Component also makes state changes we'll need a **mapDispatchToProps** function 
as well, returning an object with all its callouts translated into dispatching the appropriate Redux action. 

Redux `connect()` then combines these functions into a new higher-level Component that subscribes to the Redux 
store changes, re-rendering its (now child) `Counter` component with updated state via Component properties.

This change is also transparent so re-running the App retains the existing behavior:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/preview-06.png)](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example06/)
> Demo: [/typescript-redux/example06/](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example06/)

## Install es6-shim

Now that we've worked ourselves towards the ideal way to build a Redux-connected component, it's time to kick 
it into high gear and build something more useful. Ultimately we're going to want to expand our reducer function
to handle more state, actions and their state transitions. 

Since we're going to be supporting more actions we're going to quickly want better tools for creating 
immutable objects. TypeScript already supports ES6's 
[spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)
which helps with creating new arrays but it doesn't yet support the 
[object spread operator proposal](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) - 
something we're going to be doing a lot of. 

Instead we'll enlist the help of ES6's 
[Object.assign()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign).
As TypeScript was configured to target ES5, this isn't automatically available but we can still make it
appear with our good friend **JSPM**:

    C:\proj> jspm install es6-shim

Then use **typings** to fetch ES6's Type Definitions:

    C:\proj> typings install es6-shim --ambient --save

Since it's been awhile since our last interim build, now's a good time to cut another. First we'll expand 
**deps.tsx** to reference a bit from every dependency:

#### [deps.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/deps.tsx) 

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import * as ES6 from 'es6-shim';

var a = ES6.Object.assign({});
var store = createStore((state, action) => state, {});

class Deps extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        return <div>Hello, World!</div>;  
    }
}

var DepsRedux = connect((state) => ({}), (dispatch) => ({}))(Deps);

const ignore = () => render(<Deps/>, document.body);
```

Then instruct JSPM to cut a new bundle:

    C:\proj> jspm bundle src/deps deps.lib.js

## [Example 7 - Shape Creator](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/tree/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example07)

For our next example we'll look at scaling Redux to a larger, more advanced real-world application, exploring 
some of its benefits along the way. The world doesn't need another [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) App so I've 
opted to go with something more visual to provide a better illustration of state changes and create a 
Shape Creator App instead.

### [Counter.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example07/Counter.tsx)

We'll start by creating controls for specifying Width and Height, to do this we need to refactor our `Counter` 
into a reusable Component starting with a custom `field` property to specify the state it should manage. 
We'll also add a `step` property enabling further customization to be able to increment by a custom value.

Since we're going to be sending multiple actions I'll also adopt a semantic naming convention for action types 
going forward using the format `{Type}_{Event}`, which for a Counter update becomes `COUNTER_CHANGE`:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class Counter extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        var field = this.props.field, step = this.props.step || 1;
        return (
            <div>
                <p>
                    <label>{field}: </label>
                    <b>{this.props.counter}</b>
                </p>
                <button style={{width:30, margin:2}} onClick={e => this.props.decr(field, step)}>-</button>
                <button style={{width:30, margin:2}} onClick={e => this.props.incr(field, step)}>+</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => ({ counter: state[props.field] || 0 });

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    incr: (field, step) => {
        dispatch({ type: 'COUNTER_CHANGE', field, by: step });
    },
    decr: (field, step) => {
        dispatch({ type: 'COUNTER_CHANGE', field, by: -1 * step });
    }
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

Now that it's reusable we can create multiple instances to control the Width and Height of our Shape:

```html
<Counter field="width" step={10} />
<Counter field="height" step={10} />
```

Which gets rendered as:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/shapes-dimensions.png)

### [ColorPicker.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example07/ColorPicker.tsx)

The next Component our Shape Creator needs are controls to pick a color. The **range** INPUT control is ideal
for this as it lets us quickly change the intensity of each color using a slider. We'll need a slider for each
basic color as well as a preview area displaying the color. The only unusual thing is a function to calculate
the colors luminance, used to determine whether to show black or white contrasting text.

Otherwise `<ColorPicker />` is a pure React component without any dependencies on Redux, for that we'll 
wrap it within another higher-level Component later on:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';

export class NumberPicker extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        return (
            <p>
                <input type="range" value={this.props.value.toString() } min="0" max="255"
                    onChange={e => this.handleChange(e) } />
                <label> {this.props.name}: </label>
                <b>{ this.props.value }</b>
            </p>
        );
    }
    handleChange(event) {
        const e = event.target as HTMLInputElement;
        this.props.onChange(parseInt(e.value));
    }
}

export class ColorPicker extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        const color = this.props.color;
        const rgb = hexToRgb(color);
        const textColor = isDark(color) ? '#fff' : '#000';

        return (
            <div>
                <NumberPicker name="Red" value={rgb.r} onChange={n => this.updateRed(n)} />
                <NumberPicker name="Green" value={rgb.g} onChange={n => this.updateGreen(n) } />
                <NumberPicker name="Blue" value={rgb.b} onChange={n => this.updateBlue(n) } />
                <div style={{
                    background: color, width: "100%", height: 40, lineHeight: "40px",
                    textAlign: "center", color: textColor
                }}>
                    {color}
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
    updateRed(n: number) {
        const rgb = hexToRgb(this.props.color);
        this.changeColor(rgbToHex(n, rgb.g, rgb.b));
    }
    updateGreen(n: number) {
        const rgb = hexToRgb(this.props.color);
        this.changeColor(rgbToHex(rgb.r, n, rgb.b));
    }
    updateBlue(n: number) {
        const rgb = hexToRgb(this.props.color);
        this.changeColor(rgbToHex(rgb.r, rgb.g, n));
    }
    changeColor(color: string) {
        this.props.onChange(color);  
    }
}

const componentToHex = (c) => {
    const hex = c.toString(16);
    return hex.length == 1 ? "0" + hex : hex;
};

const rgbToHex = (r, g, b) => "#" + componentToHex(r) + componentToHex(g) + componentToHex(b);

const hexToRgb = (hex: string): { r: number; g: number; b: number; } => {
    const result = /^#?([a-f\d]{2})([a-f\d]{2})([a-f\d]{2})$/i.exec(hex);
    return result ? {
        r: parseInt(result[1], 16),
        g: parseInt(result[2], 16),
        b: parseInt(result[3], 16)
    } : null;
};

const luminance = (color: string) => {
    const rgb = hexToRgb(color);
    return 0.2126 * rgb.r + 0.7152 * rgb.g + 0.0722 * rgb.b;
};

export const isDark = (color: string) => luminance(color) < 100;
```

Which gets rendered as:

### [ShapeMaker.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example07/ShapeMaker.tsx)

Our Shape Creator is nearly there, to introduce some more state we'll also capture the **top** and 
**left** positions indicating where to place it as well as a preview area showing the color and size 
of the shape, embedding the coordinates of where it will be placed. We'll also need to add the all important 
**Add Shape** button to add the Shape to our App: 

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { isDark } from './ColorPicker';

class ShapeMaker extends React.Component<any, any> {
    constructor(props?, context?) {
        super(props, context);
        this.state = { top: props.top, left: props.left };
    }
    render() {
        var width = this.props.width, height = this.props.height, background = this.props.color;
        const color = isDark(background) ? '#fff' : '#000';
        return (
            <div>
                <p>
                    <label>size: </label>
                    <b>{height}x{width}</b>
                </p>
                <div style={{ height, width, background, color, lineHeight: height + "px", margin: "auto" }}>
                    ({this.state.top},{this.state.left})
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        <label>position: </label>
                        <input style={{width:30}} defaultValue={this.props.top} onChange={e => this.handleTop(e)} />
                        <span>,</span>
                        <input style={{width:30}} defaultValue={this.props.left} onChange={e => this.handleLeft(e)} />
                    </p>

                    <button onClick={e => this.props.addShape(background,height,width,this.state.top,this.state.left) }>
                        Add Shape
                    </button>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
    handleTop(e) {
        var top = parseInt(e.target.value);
        if (!isNaN(top))
            this.setState({ top });
    }
    handleLeft(e) {
        var left = parseInt(e.target.value);
        if (!isNaN(left))
            this.setState({ left });
    }
}

export default connect(
    (state) => ({
        width: state.width, height: state.height, color: state.color,
        top: state.nextShapeId * 10, left: state.nextShapeId * 10
    }),
    (dispatch) => ({
        addShape: (color, height, width, top, left) => {
            dispatch({ type: 'SHAPE_ADD', height, width, color, top, left });
        }
    })
)(ShapeMaker);
```

Which gets generated as:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/shapes-preview.png)

### Message-based Actions

Interestingly despite the number of moving parts of this Component it only emits a single `SHAPE_ADD` Action.
We're starting to see some of the benefits of Redux's approach as it forces us to expose our functionality 
behind coarse-grained API's disconnected from the DOM so now anyone with access to the Store automatically has
access to the Apps functionality which thanks to its message-based design
[offers a number of advantages](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Advantages-of-message-based-web-services#advantages-of-message-based-designs)
over opaque function calls, e.g. since they're just plain JavaScript objects we could easily create and 
serialize 100 `SHAPE_ADD` actions and save them into localStorage for ourselves to restore later or even send 
to someone else who could generically apply them locally with minimal effort. 

### [ShapeViewer.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example07/ShapeViewer.tsx)

Now that we've got everything we need to create shapes, we'll also need a Component to view them. 
`ShapeViewer` does this by rendering a `DIV` in the size, color and position of each Shape added:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { isDark } from './ColorPicker';

class ShapeViewer extends React.Component<any, any> {
    constructor(props?, context?) {
        super(props, context);
        this.state = { isDragging: false};
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="noselect" 
                style={{position:"relative",border:"solid 1px #ccc",width:860,height:500}}>
            { this.props.shapes.map(s => (
                <div key={s.id} style={{
                    position:"absolute",top:s.top,left:s.left,color:isDark(s.color)?'#fff':'#000',
                    background:s.color,width:s.width,height:s.height,
                    lineHeight:s.height+'px',textAlign:"center",cursor:'move'}}
                    onMouseDown={e => this.handleDragInit(e) }
                    onMouseUp={e => this.setState({ isDragging: false }) }
                    onMouseOut={e => this.setState({ isDragging: false }) }
                    onMouseMove={e => this.handleDrag(s.id, s.height, s.width, e) }>
                    ({s.top},{s.left})
                </div>)
            )}
            </div>
        );
    }
    handleDragInit(e) {
        var el = e.target as HTMLElement;
        while (el.nodeName !== 'DIV')
            el = el.parentNode as HTMLElement; //don't select text SPAN node
        var top = parseInt(el.style.top) || 0;
        var left = parseInt(el.style.left) || 0;
        this.setState({ isDragging: true, orig: { x: e.pageX - left, y: e.pageY - top} });
    }
    handleDrag(id, height, width, e) {
        if (this.state.isDragging) {
            this.props.updateShape(id, e.pageY - this.state.orig.y, e.pageX - this.state.orig.x);
        }
    }
}

export default connect(
    (state) => ({ shapes: state.shapes }), 
    (dispatch) => ({
        updateShape: (id, top, left) => dispatch({ type:'SHAPE_CHANGE', id, top, left})
    })
)(ShapeViewer);
```

When Shapes have been added, ShapeViewer renders them into an empty div container: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/shapes-viewer.png)

### Dragging shapes to generate actions

In addition to viewing all shapes ShapeViewer also includes support for moving and updating a shape's position 
as it's a fast way to generate a lot of Actions quickly that ends up being a great way to visualize and replay 
a series of state transitions. 

> For simplicity we're using mouseover events instead of the proper drag and drop API's for this so you'll 
need to start off dragging slowly, making the shape bigger also helps increases the target area.

### [ActionPlayer.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example07/ActionPlayer.tsx)

Now that we've effectively covered all our Apps functionality we can start flexing some Redux muscles. 

#### replayActions

If we've built our App correctly we should in theory be able to replay our entire App session by resetting our 
Redux store back to its default state and replaying each action sent, which is exactly what `replayActions` 
does, albeit slowly, with each action replayed 10ms apart to give the illusion of time:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';

export default class ActionPlayer extends React.Component<any, any> {
    private unsubscribe: Function;
    componentDidMount() {
        this.unsubscribe = this.props.store.subscribe(() => this.forceUpdate());
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
        this.unsubscribe();
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <button onClick={e => this.replayActions()}>replay</button>
                <p>
                    <b>{this.props.actions.length}</b> actions
                </p>
                <button onClick={e => this.undoAction()}>undo</button> <span></span>
                <button onClick={e => this.resetState()}>clear</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    resetState() {
        this.props.store.dispatch({ type: 'LOAD', state: this.props.defaultState });
        this.props.actions.length = 0;
    }
    replayActions() {
        var snapshot = this.props.actions.slice(0);
        this.resetState();

        snapshot.forEach((action, i) =>
            setTimeout(() => this.props.store.dispatch(action), 10 * i));
    }
    undoAction() {
        var snapshot = this.props.actions.slice(0, this.props.actions.length - 1);
        this.resetState();
        snapshot.forEach(action => this.props.store.dispatch(action));
    }
}
```

ActionPlayer also displays the number of Actions sent:

#### resetState

Clearing our App back to its original state doesn't get much easier, just load the apps `defaultState` and
clear the saved actions. 

#### undoAction

If the only thing our App captured were actions sent then we'll need to resort to an inefficient poor man's 
Undo of just replaying back every action except the last one. Fortunately thanks to the JavaScript VM 
performance wars this work is usually instant - making it look like we've implemented it properly :)

### [app.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example07/app.tsx)

After having implemented all the modules that make up our App, the only things left is the parent Container 
glue hosting all parts together and our Redux reducer function, implementing all action state transitions.

### Application Reducers

The implementation of the reducer function is typical for that of a Redux app with a switch statement to 
handle each action type. Without Babel's spread object operator, ES6's `Object.assign()` is the next best
thing, merging properties from multiple objects together into the first argument with properties on the right 
taking highest precedence. By using a new `{}` object for our merge target we avoid mutating existing objects
and maintain Redux's immutability contract. Although it's worth pointing out that we don't need immutability 
at this stage, our App would still function the same (including Action replay) if our reducer mutated 
existing state provided that we reset with a new defaultState object. Although there are performance, 
utility and predictability benefits for retaining immutability so it's still something you'll want to adhere to. 

A benefit of Redux single App state model is visible from the trivial implementation required to **LOAD** our 
application to a given state:

```typescript
case 'LOAD':
    return action.state;
```

Showing we don't need a special Redux function to do this, we can simply have our reducer return our desired 
state that we can pass as a normal argument in our action message.

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux';

import Counter from './Counter';
import ActionPlayer from './ActionPlayer';
import ShapeMaker from './ShapeMaker';
import ShapeViewer from './ShapeViewer';
import { ColorPicker } from './ColorPicker';

var actions = [];
var defaultState = { nextShapeId:0, width: 100, height: 100, color:"#000000", shapes:[] };

let store = createStore(
    (state, action) => {
        actions.push(action);
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'COUNTER_CHANGE':
                return Object.assign({}, state, { [action.field]: state[action.field] + action.by });
            case 'COLOR_CHANGE':
                return Object.assign({}, state, { color: action.color });
            case 'SHAPE_ADD':
                var id = state.nextShapeId;
                var shape = Object.assign({}, { id: id }, action);
                delete shape['type'];
                return Object.assign({}, state, { nextShapeId: id + 1, shapes: [...state.shapes, shape] });
            case 'SHAPE_CHANGE':
                var shape = Object.assign({}, state.shapes.filter(x => x.id === action.id)[0],
                    { top: action.top, left: action.left });
                return Object.assign({}, state,
                    { shapes: [...state.shapes.filter(x => x.id !== action.id), shape] });
            case 'LOAD':
                return action.state;
            default:
                return state;
        }
    },
    defaultState);

class ColorWrapperBase extends React.Component<any,any> {
    render() {
        return <ColorPicker color={this.props.color} onChange={this.props.setColor} />;
    }
}

const ColorWrapper = connect(
    (state) => ({ color: state.color }),
    (dispatch) => ({ setColor: (color) => dispatch({ type:'COLOR_CHANGE', color })})
)(ColorWrapperBase);

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <table>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td style={{ width: 220 }}>
                    <Counter field="width" step={10} />
                    <Counter field="height" step={10} />
                    <ColorWrapper />
                </td>
                <td style={{verticalAlign:"top", textAlign:"center", width:500}}>
                    <h2>Preview</h2>
                    <ShapeMaker />
                </td>
                <td style={{ verticalAlign: 'bottom' }}>
                    <ActionPlayer store={store} actions={actions} defaultState={defaultState} />
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colSpan={3}>
                    <h2 style={{margin:5,textAlign:'center'}}>Shapes</h2>
                    <ShapeViewer />
                </td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById("content"));
```

And with that we have a working Shape Creator in its entirety:


[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/master/img/preview-07.png)](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example07/)
> Demo: [/typescript-redux/example07/](http://servicestackapps.github.io/typescript-redux/example07/)

One point worth highlighting is that our top-level App is only ever rendered once as it's not contained
within a parent component using `setState()` to modify state and trigger re-rendering. As a result we need
to wrap our ColorPicker into a Redux-aware ColorWrapper which also maps our Redux state to its Component 
properties as well as translating the `onChange` callback into dispatching the appropriate Redux action.

## Refactoring Reducers

There are a few areas in the classic Redux implementation above I believe we can improve upon with some 
light refactoring and use of TypeScript's advanced language features. First thing on the refactor list is the
large `switch` statement whose tight coupling and multiple exit points need eliminating:

```typescript
let store = createStore(
    (state, action) => {
        actions.push(action);
        switch (action.type) {
            case 'COUNTER_CHANGE':
                return Object.assign({}, state, { [action.field]: state[action.field] + action.by });
            case 'COLOR_CHANGE':
                return Object.assign({}, state, { color: action.color });
            case 'SHAPE_ADD':
                var id = state.nextShapeId;
                var shape = Object.assign({}, { id: id }, action);
                delete shape['type'];
                return Object.assign({}, state, { nextShapeId: id + 1, shapes: [...state.shapes, shape] });
            case 'SHAPE_CHANGE':
                var shape = Object.assign({}, state.shapes.filter(x => x.id === action.id)[0],
                    { top: action.top, left: action.left });
                return Object.assign({}, state,
                    { shapes: [...state.shapes.filter(x => x.id !== action.id), shape] });
            case 'LOAD':
                return action.state;
            default:
                return state;
        }
    },
    defaultState);
```

Instead of using Redux built-in 
[combineReducers](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/api/combineReducers.html) for helping with modularity,
my preference is to instead use a dictionary of action functions which I believe is the more readable and 
flexible option. In the refactor I've also extracted reducers into a separate module, decoupling it from 
**app.tsx**:

```typescript
import reducers from './reducers';
...

let store = createStore(
    (state, action) => {
        var reducer = reducers[action.type];
        var nextState = reducer != null
            ? reducer(state, action)
            : state;

        if (action.type !== 'LOAD')
            history.add(action, nextState);

        return nextState;
    },
    defaultState);
```

#### [reducers.ts](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example08/reducers.ts)

The **reducers** module then just returns an object dictionary of action types and their respective implementations:

```typescript
import { addShape, changeShape } from './reducers/shapeReducers';

const changeCounter = (state, action) =>
    Object.assign({}, state, { [action.field]: state[action.field] + action.by });

const changeColor = (state, action) =>
    Object.assign({}, state, { color: action.color });

export default {
    COUNTER_CHANGE: changeCounter,
    COLOR_CHANGE: changeColor,
    SHAPE_ADD: addShape,
    SHAPE_CHANGE: changeShape,
    LOAD: (state, action) => action.state
};
```

Named functions improves readability and lets you develop and test each reducer implementation in isolation. 
This approach also scales well as we can further modularize related reducers into cohesive modules as done in: 

#### [shapeReducers.ts](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example08/reducers/shapeReducers.ts)

```typescript
export const addShape = (state, action) => {
    var id = state.nextShapeId;
    var shape = Object.assign({}, { id: id }, action);
    delete shape['type'];
    return Object.assign({}, state, { nextShapeId: id + 1, shapes: [...state.shapes, shape] });
};

export const changeShape = (state, action) => {
    var shape = Object.assign({}, state.shapes.filter(x => x.id === action.id)[0],
        { top: action.top, left: action.left });
    return Object.assign({}, state, { shapes: [...state.shapes.filter(x => x.id !== action.id), shape] });
};
```

## Refactoring Redux Components

There's also a few things we can do to improve on the Redux-connected Components which currently uses an 
imperative `connect()` method to create our higher-level Redux-connected Components:

```typescript
class ColorWrapperBase extends React.Component<any,any> {
    render() {
        return <ColorPicker color={this.props.color} onChange={this.props.setColor} />;
    }
}

const ColorWrapper = connect(
    (state) => ({ color: state.color }),
    (dispatch) => ({ setColor: (color) => dispatch({ type:'COLOR_CHANGE', color })})
)(ColorWrapperBase);
```

I dislike how implementations are disconnected from the Component's class declaration it applies to, 
how it needs to be defined after the class declaration instead of above to match how it conceptually works. 

If we instead extracted the implementations into separate `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` named 
functions it adds readability but then creates even more moving parts and naming clashes making it harder 
to reuse the same recipe for creating other Redux Components in the same file.

The `connect()` method is also an imperatively unnatural way to define a new Component which otherwise uses 
class declarations. It's also less readable where the source code reads as: 

> Use connect() to return a Factory constructor function that needs to be immediately invoked with your base 
Component to return a new Component that replaces your existing Component which is now an interim artifact 
to be disregarded.

### TypeScript Decorators

Whilst it's still workable, there's a better way to create Redux Components by leveraging the 
[Decorators proposal](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators/blob/master/README.md) that's an
available feature that can be enabled with the `experimentalDecorators` TypeScript compiler option. 
Currently there's no UI for this option in Visual Studio, so to enable it you'll need to edit your `.csproj` 
and add the option manually:

```xml
<TypeScriptExperimentalDecorators>true</TypeScriptExperimentalDecorators>
```

When enabled this lets you create and use decorators that despite being simple functions provide an easy way 
to compose behavior, dramatically reduce repetitive boilerplate and improve readability where we're able to 
get the ideal declarative API we want for defining Redux-connected Components in a single cohesive unit, 
with property mapping functions declared above the class declaration and all interim artifacts abstracted away
by using Redux's `connect()` as a decorator instead:

```typescript
@connect(
    (state) => ({ color: state.color }),
    (dispatch) => ({ setColor: (color) => dispatch({ type: 'COLOR_CHANGE', color }) })
)
class ColorWrapper extends React.Component<any,any> {
    render() {
        return <ColorPicker color={this.props.color} onChange={this.props.setColor} />;
    }
}
```

### Methods with Lexical bindings

Something that can have a dramatic performance improvement in React Apps is the 
[PureRenderMixin](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) which prevents unnecessary
re-rendering of a Component by checking to see if the props or state of a pure Component has changed. 
Incidentally this is something that Redux `connect()` provides automatically that thanks to immutability is 
able to do a shallow and faster object reference comparison to determine if state has changed and a Component 
needs updating.

Something that can break identity comparisons are function callbacks in ES6 classes as in order to retain
lexical `this` binding, we'd need to use the 
[fat arrow syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
at the call-site:

```typescript
export class NumberPicker extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        return (
            <p>
                <input type="range" value={this.props.value.toString()} min="0" max="255"
                    onChange={e => this.handleChange(e)} /> //new function created
                <label> {this.props.name}: </label>
                <b>{ this.props.value }</b>
            </p>
        );
    }
    handleChange(event) {
        const e = event.target as HTMLInputElement;
        this.props.onChange(parseInt(e.value));
    }
}
``` 

The problem with this is that a new 
[function identity](https://medium.com/@esamatti/react-js-pure-render-performance-anti-pattern-fb88c101332f#9bed)
is created each time invalidating property comparisons and potential Pure Render optimizations. 

An easy workaround is to use the fat arrow syntax when defining your methods:

```typescript
export class NumberPicker extends React.Component<INumberProps, any> {
    render() {
        return (
            <p>
                <input type="range" value={this.props.value.toString()} min="0" max="255"
                    onChange={this.handleChange} /> //uses same function
                <label> {this.props.name}: </label>
                <b>{this.props.value}</b>
            </p>
        );
    }
    handleChange = (event) => { //fat arrow syntax
        const e = event.target as HTMLInputElement;
        this.props.onChange(parseInt(e.value));
    }
}
```

`handleChange` now retains lexical `this` references allowing the same instance to be safely used.

## [Example 8 - Time Travelling using State Snapshots](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/tree/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example08)

In this example we'll replace `ActionPlayer` with a more complete implementation using App state snapshots. 
By using state we can implement richer History functionality complete with back, forward and any point in time 
navigation that we can fluently control with a slider enabling a "Time Travelling" experience to simulate
going back and forward throughout an App's users session.

To make it more reusable the history state management is encapsulated behind a formal API with basic operations
to navigate, reset and push the current state that gets added to by our reducer:

#### [app.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example08/app.tsx)

```typescript
var history = {
    states: [],
    stateIndex: 0,
    reset() {
        this.states = [];
        this.stateIndex = -1;
    },
    prev() { return this.states[--this.stateIndex]; },
    next() { return this.states[++this.stateIndex]; },
    goTo(index) { return this.states[this.stateIndex=index]; },
    canPrev() { return this.stateIndex <= 0; },
    canNext() { return this.stateIndex >= this.states.length - 1; },
    pushState(nextState) {
        this.states.push(nextState);
        this.stateIndex = this.states.length - 1;
    }
};

let store = createStore(
    (state, action) => {
        var reducer = reducers[action.type];
        var nextState = reducer != null
            ? reducer(state, action)
            : state;

        if (action.type !== 'LOAD')
            history.pushState(nextState);

        return nextState;
    },
    defaultState);
```

#### [History.tsx](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example08/History.tsx)

By saving and restoring entire state snapshots the implementation for our History control becomes surprisingly 
straight-forward, essentially it comes down to dispatching a **LOAD** action with the desired state:

```typescript
@subscribeToStore()
export default class History extends React.Component<any, any> {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <button onClick={this.replayStates}>replay</button>
                <span> </span>
                <button onClick={this.resetState}>clear</button>
                <p>
                    <b>{this.props.history.states.length}</b> states
                </p>
                <button onClick={this.prevState} disabled={this.props.history.canPrev()}>prev</button>
                <span> </span>
                <button onClick={this.nextState} disabled={this.props.history.canNext()}>next</button>
                <p>
                    <b>{this.props.history.stateIndex + 1}</b> position
                </p>
                <input type="range" min="0" max={this.props.history.states.length - 1}
                    disabled={this.props.history.states.length === 0}
                    value={this.props.history.stateIndex} onChange={this.goToState} />
            </div>
        );
    }
    resetState = () => {
        this.props.store.dispatch({ type: 'LOAD', state: this.props.defaultState });
        this.props.history.reset();
    }
    replayStates = () => {
        this.props.history.states.forEach((state, i) =>
            setTimeout(() => this.props.store.dispatch({ type: 'LOAD', state }), 10 * i));
    }
    prevState = () => {
        this.props.store.dispatch({ type: 'LOAD', state: this.props.history.prev() });
    }
    nextState = () => {
        this.props.store.dispatch({ type: 'LOAD', state: this.props.history.next() });
    }
    goToState = (event) => {
        const e = event.target as HTMLInputElement;
        this.props.store.dispatch({ type: 'LOAD', state: this.props.history.goTo(parseInt(e.value)) });
    }
}
```

Our Example now sports richer History capabilities complete with a fun "Time Travelling" slider :)

### [Implementing Undo History](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/recipes/ImplementingUndoHistory.html)

If you're adding undo/redo functionality to your Redux applications you're more likely going to want to apply
it to independent parts of your application rather than rolling back your entire App's state, luckily the 
[redux docs have you covered](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/recipes/ImplementingUndoHistory.html)
with an example inspired by Elm's [undo-redo package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/TheSeamau5/elm-undo-redo/2.0.0).

## [Example 9 - Real-time Networked Time Traveller](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/tree/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/src/example09)

Loading Redux Snapshots as seen in the previous example illustrates some of the natural capabilities available 
when adopting a data-flow architecture like Redux - utilizing simple actions for transitioning between 
immutable states. 

### Saving and Restoring App State

A major benefit of maintaining both state and actions in plain JavaScript objects we've yet to explore is how 
they're naturally serializable. The obvious benefit is that the entire Application state can be trivially 
saved and restored from localStorage, maintaining a user's session across multiple browser restarts:

```javascript
//Save App State
localStorage.setItem("appState", JSON.stringify(store.getState()));

//Restore App State
let store = createStore(rootReducer, 
    JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("appState")) || defaultState);
```

### Transferring State over a Network

Another example of the benefits is how easy it would be to transfer your application state to other users over 
a network. Actions are similar to diffs, i.e. minimal instructions capturing change between different states. 
So in theory we could just stream the actions to users over a network and they will be able to see changes we 
make in real-time. 

Adding support for this ends up being fairly trivial, the main architectural hurdle is how can we communicate
between users over HTTP in real-time. In desktop apps we can establish a direct network connection, but on a 
website, communications need to go via a central server. There are a few ways to enable real-time communications
over a website: polling, web sockets and server sent events. Of these options 
[Server Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events)
offers a 
[simple, efficient and natural fit for HTTP](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Server-Events) 
which we'll utilize here.

#### Example Objectives

Our objectives for this example is to provide a list of active users currently viewing the website that we 
want to enable other users to be able to **Connect** to and be able to **watch** what they're doing, i.e. 
similar to Remote Desktop into another computer's screen. Conceptually for this to work we just need to load a 
user's **initial state** then **listen** to a **stream of their actions** (generated as they're using the app). 
We also want to allow users to **disconnect** from a user's session and take over from where they left off.

#### Implementation utilizing Server Events

To enable this we'll have every user listen to a common **home** channel that we can query to find active
users and get notified as new users come and go. We'll then have each user re-publish a stream of their 
actions on their own **user channel** which multiple users can listen on to receive a stream of their actions.
To disconnect they can just unsubscribe from the **users channel**. Finally since the user's state is 
maintained in a Redux store (in their browser and not on the server) we also need to facilitate communication 
between users which we enable by sending a **direct message** to a user who can **reply** via a direct message 
back, with their current state.

Surprisingly most of the code to make this happen is encapsulated within the React `<Connect />` component below:

```typescript
/// <reference path='../../typings/browser.d.ts'/>

import * as React from 'react';
import 'jquery';
import 'ss-utils';

declare var EventSource:ssutils.IEventSourceStatic;

```

We'll go through some of the core parts to explain how this works. For the Server implementation we'll
use ServiceStack's 
[Server Events](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Server-Events) 
which includes an easy to use
[JavaScript Client](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/JavaScript-Server-Events-Client)
that simplifies the effort required to process Server Events.

ServiceStack Server Events doesn't expose any APIs for publishing messages to users out-of-the-box, instead 
access needs to be controlled by explicit Services. For this example we need a back-end Service that lets users 
publish their actions to a channel and another Service to send a direct message to a User. The 
[entire implementation](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-redux/blob/master/src/TypeScriptRedux/Global.asax.cs)
for both these services are below: 

```csharp
//Services Contract
[Route("/publish-channel/{Channel}")]
public class PublishToChannel : IReturnVoid, IRequiresRequestStream
{
    public string Channel { get; set; }
    public string Selector { get; set; }
    public Stream RequestStream { get; set; }
}

[Route("/send-user/{To}")]
public class SendUser : IReturnVoid, IRequiresRequestStream
{
    public string To { get; set; }
    public string Selector { get; set; }
    public Stream RequestStream { get; set; }
}

//Services Implementation
public class ReduxServices : Service
{
    public IServerEvents ServerEvents { get; set; }

    public void Any(PublishToChannel request)
    {
        var msg = request.RequestStream.ReadFully().FromUtf8Bytes();
        ServerEvents.NotifyChannel(request.Channel, request.Selector, msg);
    }

    public void Any(SendUser request)
    {
        var msg = request.RequestStream.ReadFully().FromUtf8Bytes();
        ServerEvents.NotifyUserId(request.To, request.Selector, msg);
    }
}
```

Essentially just using the `IServerEvents` dependency to forward the JSON Request Body to the specified 
channel or user.

### Connecting to Server Events

The JavaScript client to connect to Server Events is in the `ss-utils` npm package which we can install with:

    C:\proj> jspm install ss-utils

Then import the type definitions with:

    C:\proj> typings install ss-utils --ambient --save

As there are no built-in type definitions for HTML 5's 
[EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) the easiest way to make use of it
in TypeScript is to use the definition in ss-utils which we declare with:

```typescript
declare var EventSource:ssutils.IEventSourceStatic;
```

To make a server connection we configure the `EventSource` object with the url of the server events stream.
ServiceStack also lets you specify any initial channels you want to connect to with a queryString:

```typescript
var source = new EventSource("/event-stream?channels=home");
```

Then we use ss-utils `handleServerEvents()` jQuery function to connect to the event stream and handle any events.
The first 4 events are automatically available by ServiceStack, for notifying when:

  - **onConnect** - you've connected to the server event stream
  - **onJoin** - a user has joined a channel you're subscribed to
  - **onLeave** - a user has left a channel you're subscribed to
  - **onUpdate** - an existing user has changed the channels they've subscribed to

The remaining handlers are for application events used in this example to handle when:

  - **getState** - we're requested for our current state
  - **onState** - the user we're connected to responds with their state
  - **publishAction** - the user we're connected to publishes an action

```typescript
$(source).handleServerEvents({
    handlers: {
        //Built-in subscription Life-cycle events
        onConnect: (currentUser) => {
            currentUser.usersChannel = userChannel(currentUser.userId);
            this.setState({currentUser, users: filterUsers(this.state.users,currentUser.userId)});
            this.props.onConnect(currentUser);
        },
        onJoin: () => this.refreshUsers(),
        onLeave: () => this.refreshUsers(),
        onUpdate: (user) => this.setState({
            users: this.state.users.map(x => x.userId === user.userId ? user : x)
        }),

        //If we receive a request for our state, send a reply with our current state
        getState: (json, e) => {
            var o = JSON.parse(json);
            var index = o.stateIndex || this.props.history.stateIndex;
            var state = this.props.history.states[index];
            $.ss.postJSON(`/send-user/${o.replyTo}?selector=cmd.onState`, state);
        },
        
        //When we receive state reply from our connected user, load it         
        onState: (json, e) => {
            this.props.store.dispatch({ 
                type:'LOAD', state:json ? JSON.parse(json) : this.props.defaultState });
        },
        
        //When we receive an action from the connected user, forward it to the redux store
        publishAction: (json, e) => {
            var action = JSON.parse(json);
            this.props.store.dispatch(action);
        }
    }
});
```

To maintain an active users list, we query the event subscribers that are connected to the **home** channel 
(that everyone is initially connected to) with:

```typescript
refreshUsers() {
    $.getJSON("/event-subscribers?channels=home", users => {
        this.setState({ users: filterUsers(users, this.state.currentUser.userId) });
    });
}

//Exclude ourselves from the returned list and order the users by their id
const filterUsers = (users, userId) => 
    users.filter(x => x.userId !== userId).sort((x,y) => x.userId.localeCompare(y.userId));
```

To **connect** to a user, we first request their initial state then update our current server events 
subscription to join the new **users channel**. If we we're connected to an existing user we also want to 
unsubscribe from their users channel at the same time:

```typescript
connectToUser(userId) {
    if (userId === this.state.currentUser.userId) return;

    this.requestUsersState(userId);
    var connectedChannels = this.state.channels.filter(x => x !== "home");
    $.ss.updateSubscriber({
        SubscribeChannels: userChannel(userId), 
        UnsubscribeChannels: connectedChannels.join(',')
    }, r => {
        this.setState({
            channels:r.channels, 
            connectedToUserId: userId
        });
    });
}

const userChannel = (userId) => "u_" + userId; 
```

To request a user's state we call the `SendUser` back-end service with the `userId` we want to send to,
the `getState` handler we want to invoke and add pass our userId in the `replyTo` property of the message
request body:

```typescript
requestUsersState(userId) {
    return $.ss.postJSON(`/send-user/${userId}?selector=cmd.getState`,
        { replyTo: this.state.currentUser.userId });
}
```

The last feature to implement is disconnecting from a user which just involves unsubscribing from their 
users channel and updating our state:

```typescript
disconnect() {
    $.ss.unsubscribeFromChannels([userChannel(this.state.connectedToUserId)]);
    this.setState({ connectedToUserId: null });
}
```

That's it for the core functionality! The only other change needed is to refactor our Redux store to
publish each action we create to our **users channel** so it applies the action to all our connected users.

### Using middleware for side-effects

As this is a network side-effect we want to keep it out of our reducer implementation and make it a pure
function. The recommended way to do this is to use 
[Redux middleware](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/Middleware.html)
which lets you generically handle updates to the Redux store:

```typescript
var currentUser;
const onConnect = (user) => currentUser = user;

const updateHistory = store => next => action => {
    var result = next(action);

    if (action.type !== 'LOAD') {
        history.pushState(store.getState());
    }

    $.ss.postJSON(`/publish-channel/${currentUser.usersChannel}?selector=cmd.publishAction`, action);

    return result;
};

let store = createStore(
    (state, action) => {
        var reducer = reducers[action.type];
        var nextState = reducer != null
            ? reducer(state, action)
            : state;

        return nextState;
    },
    defaultState,
    applyMiddleware(updateHistory));
```

There's currently an [outstanding issue with redux TypeScript definition](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/pull/1413)
that makes the method signature of `applyMiddleware` incompatible with what `createStore` accepts. Until
a new TypeScript definition is released you'll need to manually edit `typings/browser/ambient/redux/redux.d.ts`
and replace the applyMiddleware definition from:

    function applyMiddleware(...middlewares: Middleware[]): Function;

to:

    function applyMiddleware(...middlewares: Middleware[]): () => any;


And with that we're done, we've now converted Shape Creator into a networked time traveller letting us connect
to active users and watch their live session in real-time - the Time Slider is now x Connected Users more fun :)

## JSPM Bundling for Production

One of the nice features of using JSPM is that it's also able to bundle your entire applicaton using your 
declared module dependencies, saving having to repeat and manage this information in an external bundler tool. 

To package your App for production run `jspm bundle` on your main app with the `-m` flag to minify your 
application, e.g we can package our last example with: 

    C:\proj> jspm bundle -m src/example09/app app.js 

JSPM still requires the `system.js` module loader and your local JSPM `config.js` which maintains your 
installed npm dependencies. The resulting `index.html` then becomes a container for our compiled application:

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>TypeScript + JSPM + React + Redux</title>
    <script src="jspm_packages/system.js"></script>
    <script src="config.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Redux Shape Creator</h1>
    <div id="content"></div>

    <script>
        System.import("./src/example09/app");
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
